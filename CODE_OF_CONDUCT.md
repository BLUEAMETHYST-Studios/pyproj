- The same thing for political views and other opinions

- Don't share too much about your life (Not only for that repository, but for everywhere on the internet, it is dangerous out there!)

### Issue Submitter

- Title and other contents of the issue should NOT be racist, sexist, they also should NOT include political opinions, insults or some kind of trolls
